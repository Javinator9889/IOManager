# IOManager
*A class designed for improving the usage of the Input/Output in your Java programs, making your life easier and faster.*


## How it works

This Java class uses *native methods* and other *implemented methods* for doing **everyday stuff** easily and fastly. For example, instead of typing `System.out.println` now is just `write` (or `writeln`).

There is also an *adaptative method* for reading from keyboard in Java: do not think more in **declaring specific types** of vars, and then capture them with a very long (and sometimes complex) syntax and parameters. Now, just assign the result of `readKeyboard` to your var.

Finally, there are also **file managing** methods implemented:
+ *Open file*
+ *Create files*
+ *Write into files* while you are reading
+ *Read files* & *byte files*
+ *More...*

## Well, you almost convinced me. How can I use it?

Here, *in the project*, you have an [example class](https://github.com/Javinator9889/IOManager/blob/master/example.java) in which you can see **the usage of all implemented** methods.
There are *console writing* samples, *file reading* and *file writing* samples and more. For a fastest view, you can see the results right here:

Also, you have `file.txt` for a complete resolution of the sample. If all of this is not enough for you, here you have the **[complete wiki](https://goo.gl/5hQdrS)** where you will be able to find all the information you need.

## Okay, okay. How to download?

Just clic *the button below button* and get all package. Then, just copy the folder "IOManager" to your project root directory

You can do:
